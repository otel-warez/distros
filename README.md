# Otel Warez Distributions

## ðŸ’€ Fun ðŸ’€

This repository aims to provide you with endless goblets of fun!

### Esoteric components

Think we can watch a blockchain with OpenTelemetry? What about SCADA systems? Or some weird scenario? Let's try them all out!

### WareZ and the love of 8-bit graphics

How can we give texture to our computer experience? We welcome fan art, especially tasteful 8-bit scenery mixing cybernetics and malice.

## For the grown-ups

This repository hosts non-official, barely maintained, fun distributions of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The distributions will feature components published as part of the OpenTelemetry or outside the project.

The implicit goal is that this will offer a sandbox for components to make their bones and mature to eventually participate in the OpenTelemetry project.

The other goal is to dogfood what it really feels like to keep up with upstream, the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder, and push for common scripts that can help everyone manage their own distributions.
